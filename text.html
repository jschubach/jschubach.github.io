        <p class="text-p">In the words of the identically named Reddit thread, we live in a boring dystopia.
          Nowhere is this reality more evident than in middle and high school, where the pressure to conform is
          conveyed in everything from the concrete block to the emphasis on standardized testing. How can this
          condition of monotony that characterizes the school experience be transfigured into one of possibility?
          How can we work with, not against, tight budgets and repetitive programs to generate a sense of wonder for students today?</p>

        <p class="text-p">We seek perfection and identicality in architecture,
          but no two students are the same, no two columns, no two pieces of cladding.
          How can we control this lack of control just enough? Instead of fighting it,
          can we use if to give a sense of craft to American architecture (which would
          might be otherwise unavailable on limited budgets due to the economies of construction
          in the US)?.</p>
