        <p class="text-p">The perceptible pressure to conform is often conveyed in the landscape of the American public high school through the emphasis on state-mandated standardized testing, monoliths of concrete block construction, and the push towards universally understood metrics of success. Within the discipline of architecture, we seek a similar standard of perfection and identicality in the contractorâ€™s execution of work. But good detailing depends on tolerances: no two students are the same, no two columns, and no two pieces of cladding. Systems that set up the conditions for success work with realities and tendencies. How can we use expansion and contraction - of the school district, the spatial field, and the detail - to inexpensively generate wonder and an expansive sense of possibility for high-school students today?</p>

          <p class="text-p">In the words of the identically named Reddit thread, we live in a boring dystopia.
            Nowhere is this reality more evident than in public middle and high schools, where the pressure to conform is
            conveyed in everything from the monoliths of concrete block to the emphasis on state-mandated standardized testing. How can this
            condition of monotony that characterizes the school experience be transfigured into one of possibility?
            How can we work with, not against, tight budgets and repetitive programs to generate a sense of wonder for
            these students today? Classroom posters say "Reach for the Stars", but how can the school show this spatially in a realistic and useful way?</p>
