      <p class="text-p">The discovery that the long-span spaces and the passing period are the most practical places to infuse wonder into the routine of the school day leads to the experiential objective of the project: that passing between classes brings you through a different world of material wonder. The structural system, the reciprocal corridor and spanning elements, then becomes a framework unifying different worlds of material wonder.</p>

How can a frame express architecture surface and multitude? Does it need to form surface, or is there another, more appropriate expression?</p>

Coupling the corridor with the long span spaces and distributing the long span spaces between clusters of classrooms means that students pass through another world between classes, the wonder-ful long span spaces. </p>

        <p class="text-p">The perceptible pressure to conform is often conveyed in the landscape of the American public high school through the emphasis on state-mandated standardized testing, monoliths of concrete block construction, and the push towards universally understood metrics of success. Within the discipline of architecture, we seek a similar standard of perfection and identicality in the contractorâ€™s execution of work. But good detailing depends on tolerances: no two students are the same, no two columns, and no two pieces of cladding. Systems that set up the conditions for success work with realities and tendencies. How can we use expansion and contraction - of the school district, the spatial field, and the detail - to inexpensively generate wonder and an expansive sense of possibility for high-school students today?</p>

          <p class="text-p">In the words of the identically named Reddit thread, we live in a boring dystopia.
            Nowhere is this reality more evident than in public middle and high schools. How can this
            condition of monotony that characterizes the school experience be transfigured into one of possibility?
            How can we work with, not against, tight budgets and repetitive programs to generate a sense of wonder for
            these students today? Classroom posters say "Reach for the Stars", but how can the school show this spatially in a realistic and useful way?</p>
