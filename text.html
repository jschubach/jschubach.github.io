        <p class="text-h">Cultural Context</p>
        <p class="text-p">In the words of the identically named Reddit thread, we live in a boring dystopia.
          Nowhere is this reality more evident than in public middle and high schools, where the pressure to conform is
          conveyed in everything from the monoliths of concrete block to the emphasis on state-mandated standardized testing. How can this
          condition of monotony that characterizes the school experience be transfigured into one of possibility?
          How can we work with, not against, tight budgets and repetitive programs to generate a sense of wonder for
          these students today? Can we create a perception of the expansion and contraction of space that will give students
          a sense of the vast possibilities that lie ahead of them whilealso giving them the ability to be focused and present in a community?</p>

        <div class="text-wrapper">
        <p class="text-h">Disciplinary Position</p>
        <p class="text-p">We seek perfection and identicality in architecture,
          but no two students are the same, no two columns, no two pieces of cladding.
          The best teachers (and the best architects) sculpt the outcome without denying or fighting against forces they can't control. How can we control this lack of control just enough?
          Instead of fighting it, can we use if to give a sense of craft to American architecture (which would
          might be otherwise unavailable on limited budgets due to the economies of construction
          in the US)?. Then perhaps the processes of teaching and learning (and of design and construction) can become a give and take of true engagement.</p>

        <p class="text-p">What is the Lou Kahn equivalent of "what does a brick want" in contemporary American architecture, where buildings are made from products and prefabricated systems?
        Is it possible to reconnect their function to their form and to articulate the spirit of these "cheap" materials? Can this kind of attitude help us to see opportunities in the construction process
        in the US, where CA is often a contentious relation between architect and contractor, punchlist items and emails?</p>
